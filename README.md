# Project 2: iOS List App

### Overview:

You will be making a iOS app  that is a list of any type of items.

**You will be working individually on this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

### What You've Learned

By the time you submit this project, you will have covered new ground  and reviewed, many of the big themes of the course so far:

* **Source Control**
* **Programming Fundamentals**
* **Auto Layout**
* **UIKit Framework**
* **UIViewController**
* **UITabBarController, UITabBar and UITabBarItem**
* **UINavigationController, UINavigationBar and UINavigationItem**
* **UITableViewController, UITableView and UITableViewCell**
* **UIScrollView**
* **Action and Manual Segues**
* **UserDefaults**
* **Debugging**

#### OPTIONS

#### Option-A (Recommended):  Your idea will be same as you did in your last project, but this time you will do it all graphical using UI controls you learned so far.

#### Option-B: Select a Project Idea of your own and you can start after getting it approved from excel sheet.**
### Requirements

#### General

* **Build a iOS application from scratch**, without a starter codebase.  Must be your own work.
* **Craft a `README.md` file that explains your app** to the world.
* **Build and run your iOS app**, where miniaze crashes as much as possible.

#### Technical

In either options your project must be able to:

* Add a new item to a list
* Edit an item from a list
* Remove an item from a list
* Clear/delete all items OR Clear/delete only marked items
* Make frequent Git commits with descriptive messages, explaining your commit

#### Stretch Goals

* Save the data to `UserDefaults`
* Mark the item as complete/favorite/\(watch, read, listen\) later/flag/etc

### README Suggestions

* Link to wireframes and user stories.
* Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.
* List unsolved problems which that would be fixed in future iterations.
* Describe how some of your favorite functionality works.

### Necessary Deliverables

Projects are due on **Thu 04/11 at 9 AM** !

Submissions will be submitted by posting into Google Sheet

The presentation must be a **5-minute presentation** in which you answer the following questions:

* What is the application about?
* What are the user stories for your application?
* Is there any information you think might help us understand what you built?
* What features did you include?
  * Make sure to explain anything "new" \(things that we didn't cover in class\)
* Demo of the application
* Walkthrough a piece of code
* What was the most difficult part of the project?
* What was your favorite part of the project?
* What would you like to add next?
